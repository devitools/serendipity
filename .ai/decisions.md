# Serendipity Project Decisions

## Architectural Decisions

### Framework Selection: Hyperf
**Decision**: Use Hyperf as the primary PHP framework
**Rationale**: 
- High-performance coroutine-based architecture
- Built-in dependency injection container
- Aspect-oriented programming support
- Excellent performance for concurrent operations
- Modern PHP framework designed for microservices

### PHP Version: 8.3+
**Decision**: Require PHP 8.3 or higher
**Rationale**:
- Access to latest language features and performance improvements
- Enhanced type system and error handling
- Better memory management and performance
- Long-term support and security updates

### Database Strategy: Multi-Database Approach
**Decision**: Use both PostgreSQL and MongoDB
**Rationale**:
- **PostgreSQL**: Excellent for relational data, ACID compliance, complex queries
- **MongoDB**: Optimal for document storage, flexible schema, horizontal scaling
- **MongoDB Replica Set**: Ensures high availability and supports transactions

### Containerization: Docker Compose
**Decision**: Use Docker Compose for development environment
**Rationale**:
- Consistent development environment across team members
- Easy service orchestration (app, databases, etc.)
- Simplified onboarding for new developers
- Production-like environment for development

## Testing Decisions

### Testing Framework: PHPUnit with Coroutine Support
**Decision**: Use PHPUnit with custom coroutine wrapper
**Rationale**:
- Industry standard testing framework
- Custom wrapper enables coroutine-based testing
- Maintains compatibility with existing PHP testing ecosystem
- Supports comprehensive test coverage reporting

### Test Coverage Requirements
**Decision**: Aim for 100% code coverage
**Rationale**:
- Ensures comprehensive testing of all code paths
- Reduces bugs in production
- Improves code quality and maintainability
- Provides confidence for refactoring

### Test Structure: Arrange-Act-Assert Pattern
**Decision**: Enforce AAA pattern in all tests
**Rationale**:
- Clear test structure and readability
- Consistent testing approach across the project
- Easier to understand test intentions
- Better maintainability

## Code Quality Decisions

### Code Style: PHP-CS-Fixer with Multiple Rule Sets
**Decision**: Use PSR2, Symfony, DoctrineAnnotation, and PhpCsFixer rule sets
**Rationale**:
- Consistent code formatting across the project
- Industry-standard coding practices
- Automated code style enforcement
- Reduces code review overhead

### Static Analysis: Multi-Tool Approach
**Decision**: Use PHPStan, Psalm, Deptrac, and PHPMD
**Rationale**:
- **PHPStan**: Excellent type checking and error detection
- **Psalm**: Additional static analysis with different strengths
- **Deptrac**: Dependency analysis and architecture enforcement
- **PHPMD**: Code complexity and maintainability metrics

### Type Safety: Strict Type Declarations
**Decision**: Enforce strict type declarations in all PHP files
**Rationale**:
- Better error detection at development time
- Improved IDE support and autocompletion
- Self-documenting code
- Reduced runtime errors

## Development Workflow Decisions

### Build Automation: Makefile
**Decision**: Use Makefile for common development tasks
**Rationale**:
- Standardized commands across different environments
- Easy onboarding for new developers
- Consistent execution of complex command sequences
- Cross-platform compatibility

### Error Tracking: Sentry Integration
**Decision**: Integrate Sentry for error tracking
**Rationale**:
- Real-time error monitoring
- Detailed error context and stack traces
- Performance monitoring capabilities
- Team collaboration features

### Logging: Monolog
**Decision**: Use Monolog for application logging
**Rationale**:
- Industry standard logging library
- Multiple handler support
- Flexible configuration options
- Integration with various logging services

## Infrastructure Decisions

### Service Architecture: Microservices-Ready
**Decision**: Design with microservices architecture in mind
**Rationale**:
- Scalability and maintainability
- Technology diversity when needed
- Independent deployment capabilities
- Better fault isolation

### Database Migrations: Structured Approach
**Decision**: Use dedicated migrations directory and tooling
**Rationale**:
- Version control for database schema changes
- Consistent database state across environments
- Rollback capabilities
- Team collaboration on database changes

## Security Decisions

### Exception Handling: Custom Handlers
**Decision**: Implement custom exception handlers
**Rationale**:
- Consistent error responses
- Security through controlled information disclosure
- Better debugging capabilities in development
- Integration with monitoring systems
