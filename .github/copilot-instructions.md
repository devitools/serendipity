# Contributor Guidelines

## Language Standards

- All comments and documentation must be written in English
- Variable names, class names, and method names should follow English naming conventions
- Never write comments in Portuguese in the codebase
- Keep commit messages in English
- When writing tests, use English for test method names and descriptions
- Use English for PHPDoc blocks

## Code Documentation

- Use clear, concise English in all comments
- Document public APIs with complete PHPDoc blocks
- Avoid unnecessary comments that simply restate what the code does
- Focus on explaining the "why" rather than the "what" in comments
- For complex logic, include English explanation of the algorithm or approach

## Process

- When reviewing code, ensure all comments are in English
- If translating legacy comments from Portuguese, ensure accuracy of technical meaning
- When discussing code in pull requests, use English
- Keep English documentation up to date with code changes

This ensures our codebase remains accessible to all developers regardless of language background.
