# Serendipity Development Guidelines

> **Note**: This document has been reorganized for better structure and maintainability. The comprehensive development information is now organized across multiple specialized documents in the `.ai/` directory.

To get started with development, load these files at the beginning of each session:
```
/remember .ai/*.md
```
